# Guide on how to use 

NOTE!!! --> You need to follow this guide by typing each command in the terminal.

I usually suggest to download VScode to have eveything a portata di mano. You can easily change the code.

I also suggest to download ```live-server``` (live-server link)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server] in order to develop the website and see the changes straight away without having to upload it to github first.

## Step 1: Install Git

First, you need to have git installed on your computer. You can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Step 2: Create GitHub Account

You need a GitHub account to interact with the repositories. Sign up [here](https://github.com/join).

## Step 3: Clone a Repository

To download or "clone" a repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/realverseJLS/realversejls.github.io.git
```

## Step 4: Change to the Repository's Directory

```bash
cd realversejls.github.io
```

## Step 5: Make Changes

Make the changes you want to the files using your preferred editor.

## Step 6: Stage the Changes

Once you're done making changes, you can stage them for commit with:

```bash
git add .
```

The . means you're staging all the changes you made. If you want to stage only one file, replace . with the file's name.

## Step 7: Commit the Changes

Next, commit the changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

Replace Your commit message with a brief description of the changes you made.

## Step 8: Push the Changes

Finally, push the changes to the GitHub repository:

```bash
git push
```

You might need to enter your GitHub username and password.

## Step 9: Wait and refresh the page

Once every step has been completed, the new version should appear on the website.
